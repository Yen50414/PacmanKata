Controls:

wasd for Up, Left, Down, and Right.

The Enter key is used to activate the command since this is a console application.

Entering the space key will exit the game.


Pacman Grid:

The grid is 28x31, the same size counted from the original Pacman game.  Implementation wise this can be reworked to be flexible but since Pacman's spawn point is set currently, it might cause problems.


Pacman Character:

Pacman is set to spawn at 14, 23, roughly where he'd spawn in the original Pacman game.  Pacman's spawn point should be parameterized so the grid isn't limited in size by where Pacman spawns.
