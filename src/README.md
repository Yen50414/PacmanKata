Controls:

wasd for Up, Left, Down, and Right.

The Enter key is used to activate the command since this is a console application.

Entering the space key will exit the game.


Pacman Grid:

The grid is 28x31, the same size counted from the original Pacman game.  The board is a much simpler design, with walls on all sides and no maze like design at all.

Implementation wise the constructor can specify the size of the grid, though a minimum grid size of 4x4 is required.


Pacman Character:

Pacman is set to spawn at 14, 23, roughly where he'd spawn in the original Pacman game.

Pacman's spawn point can be specified to the constructor to allow testing as well as more complex grid designs.
